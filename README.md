# Ryanair Take-Off Weight Prediction

This project aims to build a regression model for predicting the Take-Off Weight (TOW) of Ryanair flights based on historical flight data.

The dataset includes features such as departure date, actual flight time, number of passengers, baggage count and weight, and other operational parameters. Based on these features, the model learns to estimate the TOW, which can be useful for operational planning, fuel consumption optimization, and logistics analysis.

The project serves as a practical example of:
- applying regression modeling to real-world aviation data,
- performing exploratory data analysis (EDA),
- developing and evaluating machine learning models for business-related use cases.

The goal is not only to achieve accurate predictions but also to demonstrate a full data science workflow including data analysis, modeling, evaluation, and result presentation.
